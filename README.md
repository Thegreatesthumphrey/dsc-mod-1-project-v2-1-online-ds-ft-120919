# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction
For this project we focused on the movie industry. We looked at data from:

    - IMDB
    - TMDB
    - Box Office Mojo
    - Rotten Tomatoes

to try and gain some insight as to which factors affect movie performance.

## Navigating This Repo
You'll see a few different files in here, all of which serve a specific purpose.

### Getting Set Up
1. data_import.ipynb
    - This is simply importing all of the given data into our sqlite database and getting it ready for EDA. I had to handle both       .csv and .tsv files
    
2. clean_and_eda.ipynb
    - In this file, I went through each table and prepared it for analysis, as well as performing some preliminary exploration on     the data. This is where I checked for any missing values, made all data types consistent, and made sure the data was ready for     analysis. NOTE: Most EDA was performed within the context of each individual question I was posing.
